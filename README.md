Our project aims to revolutionize mental health and medical diagnostics through an integrated AI-driven platform. This AI psychiatrist will analyze user emotions and provide personalized health recommendations, which can be used for purchasing health-related products. Our app features advanced AI diagnostics for MRI and CT scans, enhancing early disease detection, and offers tailored suggestions and medication if required. Users can access details and locations of nearby doctors and counselors for physical visits. Additionally, our platform includes a support group page where users can anonymously share their experiences and receive responses from counselors. In emergencies, our app triggers real-time voice recording and alerts nearby users through Google Fit integration, fostering a community-driven safety network. Furthermore, we securely store signs of depression via blockchain technology. Users earn health coins for various activities, which can later be used for purchases, thus incentivizing engagement and promoting a holistic approach to well-being.
